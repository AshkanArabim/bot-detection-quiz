# bot-detection-quiz
As part of a research project to see how users classified different tweets (bot-generated or not), I made this little website using ReactJS. I'd say, I learned a whole lotta react during this time!!

The back-end folder is just there for the lolz. It doesn't do anything. The whole sample dataset is literally a JSON file. 

Feel free to fork, and use as a template :)
